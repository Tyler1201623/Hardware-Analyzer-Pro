Python Hardware Analyzer Project - Implementation
Overview
This Python version retains all the features of the original C++ project while leveraging Python libraries like psutil, platform, and optional packages such as py3nvml for advanced GPU analysis. Python makes the tool portable, maintainable, and easily extendable.

Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Setup
Project Initialization

Directory creation and requirements.txt setup.
Initialize with venv for environment isolation.
Command:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Logging & Utilities

Create logging_util.py for log management with the logging module.
Develop utils.py for reusable helpers like file I/O.
Add config.py to handle JSON-based configuration.
Phase 2: Core Functional Modules
Hardware Manager

hardware_manager.py acts as the orchestrator for all components.
CPU Analysis

Use psutil for CPU details like cores, threads, speed.
Leverage platform for OS-specific details.
RAM Analysis

Use psutil.virtual_memory() to retrieve total, used, and available memory.
Storage Analysis

Implement psutil.disk_partitions() and psutil.disk_usage() for storage stats.
GPU Analysis

Use py3nvml for NVIDIA GPUs or system-specific commands for others.
Parse VRAM, GPU name, and vendor information.
Phase 3: Testing
Unit Tests

Write tests for individual modules in tests/.
Integration Tests

Ensure compatibility between hardware_manager.py and core modules.
Cross-Platform Validation

Test on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
Phase 4: Optimization & Reporting
Performance Optimization

Use asynchronous I/O and optimize queries with caching.
Export Functionality

Create JSON and CSV reports with Python's json and csv modules.
Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment
Documentation

Use Sphinx for API documentation.
Update README.md with usage instructions.
Deployment

Package with PyInstaller for standalone executables:
bash
Copy code
pyinstaller --onefile src/main.py
